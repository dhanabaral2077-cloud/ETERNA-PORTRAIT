        content: `
      <p>Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is one of life's most difficult experiences. Our pets are not just animals; they are family members, confidants, and sources of unconditional love. When they pass, the silence they leave behind can be deafening.</p>
      
      <h2>Why a Memorial Portrait Matters</h2>
      <p>A custom pet portrait serves as a tangible connection to the memories you shared. Unlike a digital photo buried in your phone, a framed portrait in your home is a daily reminder of the joy they brought into your life. It transforms grief into a celebration of their legacy.</p>

      <h2>Choosing the Right Style</h2>
      <p>When commissioning a memorial piece, consider the mood you want to evoke:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Classic Oil Style:</strong> Offers a timeless, museum-quality feel that honors their dignity.</li>
        <li><strong>Modern Watercolor:</strong> Soft and ethereal, perfect for capturing a gentle spirit.</li>
        <li><strong>Black and White:</strong> Striking and emotional, focusing purely on their expression.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Healing Power of Art</h2>
      <p>Many of our clients tell us that the process of choosing a photo and seeing their pet "come alive" in art is incredibly therapeutic. It provides a way to channel love and grief into creating something beautiful that will last forever.</p>

        excerpt: "Confused about the difference between digital hand-painting and traditional canvas art? We break down the pros and cons to help you choose the perfect medium for your masterpiece.",
        content: `
      <p>In the world of custom pet portraits, technology has opened up exciting new possibilities. At Eterna Portrait, we specialize in <strong>hand-painted digital art</strong>, but how does it compare to traditional oil painting?</p>

      <h2>What is Digital Hand-Painting?</h2>
      <p>Digital painting isn't just a computer filter. An artist uses a stylus and tablet to brush every stroke by hand, just like traditional painting, but on a digital canvas. This allows for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unlimited Revisions:</strong> We can tweak the eye color or fur shade until it's perfect.</li>
        <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Digital files never crack or fade over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> You can print your art on canvas, mugs, pillows, or phone cases.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Traditional Charm</h2>
      <p>Traditional oil paintings have a texture and smell that some collectors love. However, they are often 3-4x more expensive and take months to dry and ship. Digital art offers the same visual impact and emotional depth at a fraction of the time and cost.</p>

      <h2>The Verdict</h2>
      <p>If you want museum-quality aesthetics with modern flexibility and a satisfaction guarantee, digital hand-painting is the superior choice for most pet owners.</p>

        excerpt: "The secret to a breathtaking portrait isn't the artist—it's the photo! Learn how to capture your pet's personality with your smartphone camera.",
        content: `
      <p>We can work magic, but we aren't mind readers! The reference photo you provide is the blueprint for your artwork. Here is how to capture a shot that guarantees a stunning result.</p>

      <h2>1. Natural Light is Your Best Friend</h2>
      <p>Avoid flash at all costs. It causes "laser eyes" and washes out fur texture. Instead, take photos outside on an overcast day or near a large window. Soft, natural light highlights the depth in their eyes.</p>

      <h2>2. Get Down on Their Level</h2>
      <p>Don't stand over your pet. Crouch down, lie on the grass, or sit on the floor. Eye-level shots create a connection and make your pet look regal rather than small.</p>

      <h2>3. The "Treat Tease"</h2>
      <p>Want that alert, perky-eared look? Hold a treat or a squeaky toy just above the camera lens. This grabs their attention and creates that spark of excitement in their eyes.</p>

      <h2>4. Focus on the Eyes</h2>
      <p>The eyes are the soul of the portrait. Ensure they are sharp and in focus. If the eyes are blurry, the entire portrait will feel "off."</p>

      <h2>5. Capture the Quarks</h2>
      <p>Does your dog have a crooked ear? Does your cat have a signature smirk? Don't try to make them look perfect; make them look like <em>them</em>.</p>

        excerpt: "Tired of giving generic gift cards? Find out why a personalized pet portrait is the most thoughtful, emotional, and memorable gift you can give this holiday season.",
        content: `
      <p>Gift-giving is an art. You want to give something that says, "I know you, and I know what you love." For the 70% of households that own a pet, there is no better gift than a custom portrait.</p>

      <h2>1. It evokes pure emotion</h2>
      <p>We've seen it time and time again—the "unboxing tears." Seeing their beloved fur baby immortalized as art triggers an emotional response that a sweater or gadget simply can't match.</p>

      <h2>2. It's truly one-of-a-kind</h2>
      <p>No two portraits are alike. This isn't something they can buy at a big-box store. It's a bespoke creation made specifically for them.</p>

      <h2>3. It lasts a lifetime</h2>
      <p>Flowers wilt, and chocolates get eaten. A museum-quality canvas print lasts for generations, becoming a family heirloom that preserves the memory of a cherished companion.</p>

      <h2>4. It fits any occasion</h2>
      <p>Christmas, birthdays, anniversaries, or "just because"—a pet portrait is always appropriate and always appreciated.</p>

        excerpt: "Pet portraits aren't just sentimental; they are chic decor statements. Learn how to incorporate custom pet art into your living room, bedroom, or gallery wall.",
        content: `
      <p>Gone are the days of tacky pet posters. Modern custom pet portraits are sophisticated pieces of art that can elevate your home's interior design. Here is how to style them like a pro.</p>

      <h2>The Statement Piece</h2>
      <p>Hang a large, single canvas (24x36" or larger) above a fireplace or sofa. This creates a bold focal point. Choose a background color for the portrait that contrasts with your wall color for maximum impact.</p>

      <h2>The Gallery Wall</h2>
      <p>Mix your pet portrait with other art pieces, family photos, and mirrors. This creates an eclectic, lived-in vibe. Use matching frames to tie the look together.</p>

      <h2>The Nook</h2>
      <p>Create a cozy corner with a reading chair, a small side table, and your pet's portrait hanging above. It's a subtle way to add personality to smaller spaces.</p>

      <h2>Color Coordination</h2>
      <p>At Eterna Portrait, we can customize the background color of your art. Match it to your throw pillows or rug to create a cohesive design thread throughout the room.</p>
